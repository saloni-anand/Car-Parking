# Car-Parking
An efficient and time saving Car Parking system made using modern technology.    
Compiler used: Dev C++    
It consists of multiple different functions that execute tasks such as inserting a car that has arrived, removing a car that has left, display the no. of cars that have arrived, calculate the cost of parking for the specified amount of time used by each car respectively.    
Our program uses File handling to store the data inputs given by the user and can be accessed for future use. It takes inputs of the cars that have arrived and the details of the driver, the car number, time slot, number of hours of stay. This information can be accessed after returning to the program after it has already been closed.    
It calculates the cost for each car according to the number of hours it has used the parking lot. The details of the cars stay in the program file until they are deleted once the car has left the parking lot.
